# The Orange Book

By Chase Bryan

## Manuscript status

This expansion is a living, in-progress manuscript. It is not a finished
book, and it is not an independent review.

| Part | Drafted in this tree | Only planned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Part 1, The Novice | The opening, Chapters 1–6, and lessons N7–N14 | No further novice lesson is named |
| Part 2, The Journeyman | None | J2, J3, and J4 (Block A), J5, and the connecting studies below |
| Part 3, The Master | None | The connecting studies and the capstone dossier below |

The opening was approved by the owner before the continuation. Later
corrections in that same file, Chapters 4–6, and N7–N14 are draft and
unreviewed. Journeyman and Master lessons are not written in this tree.
The original seventeen chapters and four appendices stay in
[THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md). The machine-readable index
of drafted and planned chapters is [manifest.json](manifest.json).

Three-part study structure, opening and programming continuation — 2026-10-05.

This directory is part of *The Orange Book*, not a second book. It supplies
new foundational teaching and a three-part reading structure for the existing
manuscript. The original seventeen chapters, four appendices, manuscript map,
and source disclosure remain in [THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md).
They are linked below rather than copied, so corrections continue to have
one source of truth.

The baseline inspected for this increment is manuscript 0.26, snapshot
2026-10-02, file blob `78cf89362dd3bab2639f756e2815d4a0e4582ffb` at repository
commit `c3f529ef568a46ccb3e95dff0c41bc7f06c8792e`. This baseline identifies what
was read; it is not a release or assurance claim.

The part names below are fixed by the owner. Placement of existing chapters
is an editorial integration draft. Existing chapter numbers and anchors
remain unchanged during migration. The new opening and continuation have
Chapters 1–6 of the novice sequence; a link to an original chapter retains
that manuscript's number until the complete sequence is ready to renumber
consistently.

## Part 1, The Novice

Begin without assumed programming or cryptography knowledge. Establish the
meaning of a term before relying on it, and build enough mathematics to
understand each operation rather than memorize its notation.

### Available manuscript

- [A word before we begin](NOVICE_OPENING.md#a-word-before-we-begin): the
  author-to-reader teaching relationship, study method, and scope of the book.
- [Chapter 1: Before You Hide Anything](NOVICE_OPENING.md#chapter-1-before-you-hide-anything):
  messages, confidentiality, adversary assumptions, public rules and keys,
  specification and implementation, examples and general arguments, integrity
  and authenticity. Six exercises with worked answers.
- [Chapter 2: Two Marks, Many Possibilities](NOVICE_OPENING.md#chapter-2-two-marks-many-possibilities):
  quantity and notation, arithmetic symbols, place value, binary, bits,
  finite strings, counting, powers, bytes, hexadecimal, and interpretation.
  Nine exercises with worked answers.
- [Chapter 3: A Rule You Can Undo](NOVICE_OPENING.md#chapter-3-a-rule-you-can-undo):
  Boolean values, truth tables, AND/OR/XOR/NOT, bitwise operations, masks,
  a complete cancellation argument, loss and retention of information,
  grouping, parity, and the scope of exhaustive checks. Ten exercises with
  worked answers.

- [Chapter 4: A Place to Work](NOVICE_PROGRAMMING.md#chapter-4-a-place-to-work):
  files, directories, paths, plain text, terminals and shells, arguments,
  exit status, source revisions, compiler identity and reproducible working
  records. Seven exercises with answers. One explicit POSIX-style command
  track, not an untested claim of identical installation on every platform.
- [Chapter 5: Tell the Machine Exactly](NOVICE_PROGRAMMING.md#chapter-5-tell-the-machine-exactly):
  a first complete Orange program, every delimiter explained, functions,
  types, expressions, parameters, arguments, scope, calls, diagnostics and
  the distinction between accepted source and fulfilled intention. Eight
  exercises with answers; includes a deliberately rejected literal.
- [Chapter 6: Words Have Edges](NOVICE_PROGRAMMING.md#chapter-6-words-have-edges):
  finite words, signed mathematical integers, Euclidean division, modular
  arithmetic, wrapping, shifts, rotations, literal and computed amounts,
  explicit grouping and the inverse of a small nonsecure composition.
  Twelve exercises with answers; includes a deliberately ungrouped program.
- **N7.** [Name the Intermediate Step](NOVICE_N7_NAME_THE_INTERMEDIATE_STEP.md#n7-name-the-intermediate-step):
  bindings, explicit conversions, arrays with literal indices, and the
  ChaCha20 quarter round written with the intermediate names of RFC 8439
  §2.1. Rejected forms include `x + y as Word[32]`, a literal index past
  the array, a loop index whose proved range leaves the array, and an
  `Int` parameter used as an index. The lesson also chooses with `Bool`
  and `if`, returns the quarter round as one tuple, and repeats with a
  bounded `for` whose index is proved in range before it runs. Twelve
  exercises with worked answers. The lesson's finish line is the four
  outcomes in that section.
  N7 is not the manuscript chapter titled No Disposable Prototype.
- **N8.** [Read and Repair a Program](NOVICE_N8_READ_AND_REPAIR.md#n8-read-and-repair-a-program):
  predicting an `ORC` code and its locus, then confirming with `orangec
  check`, `eval`, and `test`. Repairs stay on the N7 surface: grouping,
  `as`, a literal index, a bounded-loop index, and a test whose expected
  word is wrong. A silent check means the source was well-formed. A passing
  test means one claim's `Bool` was true. Ten exercises with worked answers.
  N8 is not the manuscript chapter titled Orange 2026: The Smallest Honest
  Slice.
- **N9.** [Say What You Mean](NOVICE_LOGIC.md#n9-say-what-you-mean):
  sets, membership, subsets, relations, functions and inverses, quantifiers,
  implication, equivalence, negation, cases, contradiction, contrapositive,
  induction, invariants, and finite exhaustive arguments. Twenty exercises
  with worked answers. One Orange listing writes the successor step of
  Assumption N9.4 as a bounded `for` inside a `test`. The label is lesson N9.
  It is not a manuscript chapter numeral.
  [Worked answers](NOVICE_LOGIC.md#worked-answers-n9).
- **N10.** [Count What You Do Not Know](NOVICE_PROBABILITY.md#n10-count-what-you-do-not-know):
  fractions, ratios, finite probability spaces, conditional knowledge,
  independence, an elementary birthday bound, expected value, and base-two
  logarithms. Key length, the distribution a key is drawn from, and an
  adversary's uncertainty are separated. Sixteen exercises with worked
  answers. Nine Orange listings check the integer identities behind the
  fractions. Eight evaluate; the empty loop is rejected. The listings do
  not draw an outcome. The label is lesson N10. It is not a manuscript
  chapter numeral. N10 does not use the formal vocabulary
  reserved for Say What You Mean.
- **N11.** [Protect More Than Appearance](NOVICE_PROTECT.md#n11-protect-more-than-appearance):
  encoding, encryption, hashing, and authentication as separate claims;
  the shift, affine, substitution, and Vigenère schemes, each proved
  correct and then broken under a stated rule; keys, distributions,
  nonces, and counters; the one-time pad with an elementary proof of
  perfect secrecy; the two-time pad shown by XOR. Twelve Orange listings,
  three of them intentionally rejected. Sixteen exercises with worked
  answers. The label is lesson N11. It is not manuscript Chapter 11,
  *Standards as Versioned Inputs*.
- **N12.** [The First Complete Study](NOVICE_N12_THE_FIRST_COMPLETE_STUDY.md#n12-the-first-complete-study):
  the ChaCha20 block function of RFC 8439 §2.3, including the quarter
  round of §2.1, derived by hand and transcribed in Orange against the
  §2.3.2 vector. The lesson separates a mathematical property, a test,
  and an implementation behavior, and it stops at the block function.
  Twelve exercises with worked answers. The four outcomes in that section
  are the finish line. The label is lesson N12. It is not a manuscript
  chapter numeral.
- **N13.** [Modules and Provenance](NOVICE_N13_MODULES_AND_PROVENANCE.md#n13-modules-and-provenance):
  a SHA-256 module and an HMAC module in separate files, the second
  calling the first by module name. Each expected digest is pinned to
  a standard, an edition, and a vector, and the lesson states what the
  comparison does not cover. One pad claim is proved by hand and
  matched by an Orange test on a finite domain. Three seam failures
  are the compiler's own diagnostics, each repaired only where the
  diagnostic points. Ten exercises with worked answers. The five
  outcomes in that section are the finish line. The label is lesson
  N13. It is not manuscript Chapter 13, *Interoperability and External
  Validation*.
- **N14.** [Ready for Standards](NOVICE_N14_READY_FOR_STANDARDS.md#n14-ready-for-standards):
  the gate after N13. One cut of the N13 pad seam, in two files, is
  interpreted construct by construct; one byte is derived beside its
  Orange name; one `test` is given its finite domain and its
  non-claims; and the assumptions a Block A reader and a J5 reader
  still carry are listed. The desk exam demands the same four acts
  on the N12 sample line, which this lesson does not walk. Eight
  exercises with worked answers. The five outcomes in that section
  are the finish line. Failing them means the reader is not ready
  for J2–J4. The label is lesson N14. It is not a manuscript
  chapter numeral. The lesson does not transcribe the SHA-256
  compression function or its message schedule.

The opening was approved by the owner before this continuation. Later
corrections to its worked reversal example, counting argument, and
hexadecimal answer are in the opening file; this index describes that
corrected source. Chapters 4–6, N7, N8, N9, N10, N11, N12, N13, and N14, and the new executable checks remain
reviewable new work. Across the six chapters there are 52 exercises with
worked answers. N7 adds twelve further exercises in its own file. N8 adds
ten further exercises in its own file. N9 adds 20. N10 adds sixteen
further exercises, numbered N10.1 onward. N11 adds sixteen further
exercises, numbered N11.1 onward. N12 adds twelve further exercises,
numbered N12.1 onward. N13 adds ten further exercises, numbered N13.1
onward. N14 adds eight further exercises, numbered N14.1 onward.

### Remaining teaching sequence

Item 1 is drafted as N7. Item 2 is drafted as N8. Item 3 is drafted as N9
and listed above. Item 4 is drafted as N10. Item 5 is drafted as N11.
Item 6 is drafted as N12. Item 7 is drafted as N13. Extend the manuscript in the following dependency order:

1. **Name the Intermediate Step.** Drafted in
   [N7](NOVICE_N7_NAME_THE_INTERMEDIATE_STEP.md#n7-name-the-intermediate-step).
   Expressions, grouping, bindings, explicit conversions, arrays, indexing,
   bounds, conditions, tuples and bounded iteration, introduced in
   dependency order with supported examples. The four outcomes in N7 are
   the finish line.
2. **Read and Repair a Program.** Drafted in
   [N8](NOVICE_N8_READ_AND_REPAIR.md#n8-read-and-repair-a-program).
   Parsing, type checking, evaluation, diagnostics, minimal repairs,
   known-answer tests, and the difference between a silent check and a
   passing test. The five outcomes in N8 are the finish line.
3. **Say What You Mean.** Drafted as
   [N9: Say What You Mean](NOVICE_LOGIC.md#n9-say-what-you-mean).
   The locked label is N9. It does not use a manuscript chapter numeral.
   N7 and N8 stay ahead of it in this order and are not part of that file.
4. **Count What You Do Not Know.** Drafted as
   [N10](NOVICE_PROBABILITY.md#n10-count-what-you-do-not-know).
   Fractions, ratios, probability, conditional knowledge, independent
   choices, powers and logarithms; distinguish key length, distribution
   and adversary uncertainty. The locked label is N10. It does not use a
   manuscript chapter numeral.
5. **Protect More Than Appearance.** Drafted as
   [N11](NOVICE_PROTECT.md#n11-protect-more-than-appearance).
   Explicitly educational shift, affine, substitution, and Vigenère
   constructions, each with a stated break; encoding, encryption,
   hashing, and authentication; keys, distributions, nonces, and
   counters; the one-time pad and its exact conditions. The six outcomes
   in N11 are the finish line. The locked label is N11. It does not use a
   manuscript chapter numeral. Do not introduce a practical primitive
   before its prerequisites.
6. **The First Complete Study.** Drafted as
   [N12](NOVICE_N12_THE_FIRST_COMPLETE_STUDY.md#n12-the-first-complete-study).
   The ChaCha20 block function of RFC 8439 §2.3, with the quarter round
   of §2.1, a hand-derived expected result, a transcription, a deliberate
   error, a repair, and a precisely scoped explanation of what was
   established. The four outcomes in N12 are the finish line.
   The locked label is N12. It does not use a manuscript chapter numeral.
7. **Modules and Provenance.** Drafted as
   [N13](NOVICE_N13_MODULES_AND_PROVENANCE.md#n13-modules-and-provenance).
   A hash module and a keyed module in separate files, a call by module
   name, the provenance of each expected digest, one composition claim
   with an Orange test on a finite domain, and a seam diagnostic the
   reader repairs. The five outcomes in N13 are the finish line.
   The locked label is N13. It does not use a manuscript chapter numeral.
   It is not manuscript Chapter 13.
8. **Ready for Standards.** Drafted as
   [N14](NOVICE_N14_READY_FOR_STANDARDS.md#n14-ready-for-standards).
   A gate, not a new language slice and not Block A. The reader
   interprets one program, derives one operation, explains one test's
   finite domain, and locates the assumptions a later standard study
   still carries. The five outcomes in N14 are the finish line.
   The locked label is N14. It does not use a manuscript chapter numeral.
   It does not transcribe FIPS 180-4 §6.2.2.

The readiness check for Part 2 is demonstrated reasoning, not a certificate
or an assertion that reading alone confers competence. The reader should be
able to interpret a complete small Orange program, derive its elementary
operations, explain the domain of a test, and locate each assumption in a
claim. That check is drafted as N14. A reader who cannot do it on a
listing the lesson did not walk is not ready for J2–J4.

## Part 2, The Journeyman

Work from mathematical definitions and authoritative standards to complete
constructions, then investigate representation, composition and implementation
hazards. Establish algorithm prerequisites before presenting the algorithm.
Orange is the working language, not decoration around prose.

### Existing manuscript integrated here

| Existing chapter | Role in the new progression |
| --- | --- |
| [From Surface Text to Meaning](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-4-from-surface-text-to-meaning) | Develops the novice's reading of source into a disciplined account of meaning. |
| [Orange 2026: The Smallest Honest Slice](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-8-orange-2026-the-smallest-honest-slice) | Connects exercises to implemented capability and its limits. Retain slice-status qualifications. |
| [Standards as Versioned Inputs](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-11-standards-as-versioned-inputs) | Turns reading a standard into a reproducible specification task. |
| [The Corpus as Acceptance Test](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-12-the-corpus-as-acceptance-test) | Connects worked constructions to coverage, test provenance and acceptance boundaries. |
| [Secrets Are a Semantic Concern](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-6-secrets-are-a-semantic-concern) | Develops secrecy from a message-level goal into a property of computation and observation. |
| [Interoperability and External Validation](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-13-interoperability-and-external-validation) | Tests whether agreement survives contact with independent implementations and explicit validation scopes. |

### Teaching that must connect those chapters

Develop modular arithmetic into rings and finite fields; probability into
entropy and security parameters; functions into state transformations; and
program evaluation into resource use and observation. Teach byte order,
serialization and format boundaries before comparing standard test vectors.

Derive representative stream and block constructions, hashes, MACs, key
derivation and authenticated encryption. ChaCha20, SHA-256, HMAC, Poly1305 and
AES are candidate running studies tied to exact standards and the repository's
supported examples. Public-key study must first establish its number theory,
then groups and fields, followed by representative encryption, key exchange,
elliptic-curve and signature constructions. Distinguish mathematical
correctness, security models, implementation quality and safe composition.

Address randomness generation, nonce requirements, key lifecycle, side
channels, failure handling, misuse and interoperability where the relevant
construction makes the question concrete. Teach the necessary algebra,
complexity and probability before treating modern lattice- and hash-based
post-quantum constructions. Pin standards and parameter choices when those
chapters are actually written; this index selects no current recommendation.

Each substantial study needs a definition, derivation, supported Orange
expression, provenance of expected results, checked examples, diagnostic
exercise, and explicit non-claims. A name in this curriculum grants no
compiler feature and no production-security endorsement.

## Part 3, The Master

Investigate the meaning and justification of a claim about an exact artifact.
This is where the original book's assurance and architectural core receives
its full treatment, supported by the earlier mathematics and practice.

### Existing manuscript integrated here

| Existing chapter | Role in the new progression |

| [Releases, Updates, and Failure](../THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md#chapter-17-releases-updates-and-failure) | Carries assurance reasoning through change, replacement and failure. |

### Teaching that must connect those chapters

Develop formal operational and denotational accounts where each is needed;
syntax, judgments and derivations; invariants, refinement and equivalence;
security games, adversary resources and reductions; leakage models and
constant-time claims; proof objects, checking, counterexamples and solver
boundaries. State prerequisites locally and point to their canonical
introduction rather than relying on prestige vocabulary.

Then treat intermediate representations, compiler preservation, translation
validation, machine models, ABIs, memory and foreign-language obligations,
artifact identity, reproducibility, provenance and claim composition. Follow
each assertion to its evidence, assumptions and trusted components. Separate
source-level properties from properties of compiled bytes and physical
execution.

The capstone is an auditable claim dossier: an identified artifact, exact
property and domain, explicit assumptions, reproducible supporting evidence,
a failure or counterexample analysis, and a defensible statement of what
remains unestablished. It must not be called verified merely because the
reader completed it.

Expand the final reference matter with a notation register, topic and
algorithm indexes, symbol-to-language mapping, prerequisites, exercise
solutions and a standards bibliography. Generate indexes from actual
manuscript anchors; do not publish empty indexes as completed content.

## Editorial rules for continuing the manuscript

Speak as the author teaching one reader. Use direct address to invite a
prediction, locate a mistake, or demand a reason. Do not invent personal
experience, credentials, historical recollections or endorsements. Let
philosophical insight emerge from a technical distinction the reader has
just earned; do not insert a slogan on every page.

Give each concept one canonical definition. Revisit it only to apply it,
qualify it, connect it, or increase its depth. Necessary retrieval practice is
not redundant explanation. Brevity must not remove a prerequisite, a proof
step, an accessibility aid, an important exception or an answer's reasoning.

Introduce symbols and technical terms before asking the reader to use them.
Mark deliberate previews as previews. Separate definition, proposition,
example, implementation observation and proposed capability. A truth table
can establish a finite result; a sample of successful runs cannot silently
establish a universal result.

Open each newly completed chapter with a brief, relevant quotation from a
cryptographer, verified against a primary publication or the speaker's own
record. Record exact wording, context, page or section, consulted version,
translation status and verification date. Do not invent an epigraph for an
unfinished chapter or alter an attributed quotation to improve its prose.
The existing chapters still require their own sourced epigraph and voice
revision; this increment has not represented that work as done.

The names `Current`, `Directed`, `Proposed`, and `Future` retain their existing
meanings. The manuscript does not ratify a semantic proposal, settle D-018,
claim trademark clearance, or qualify a release. Any later renumbering must
preserve or redirect incoming anchors and update all internal references.

## Validation and review boundary

Run the reference checks from the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/test_book_foundations.py
```

These checks validate the worked examples, finite models, the 52 chapter
answers, the N7 answers, the 10 lesson-N8 answers, the 20 lesson-N9
answers, the 16 lesson-N10 answers, the 16 lesson-N11 answers, the 12 lesson-N12
answers and the N12 integer ledger, the 10 lesson-N13 answers and the N13
integer ledger, the 8 lesson-N14 answers and the N14 integer ledger, and document structure. Python test
discovery through
`tools/tests/test_book_foundations.py` loads those checks and the two
printed-continuation audits.
They do not execute Orange, establish a cryptographic security claim, or
constitute independent review. The index preserves all seventeen original
chapter links without changing the original file. Check repository-wide
links and documentation policy in CI before any merge.

The Rust integration test `compiler/crates/orangec/tests/book_novice.rs`
extracts the nine actual Orange listings from the continuation and runs the
compiler against the seven expected successes and two intended rejections.
It also checks that removing the computed-amount parentheses exposes the
literal guard. The same test reads the Orange listings in N7 and checks
their printed results and intended rejections. The same test reads the
Orange listings in N8 and checks the printed values, the printed
diagnostics, the failing and passing tests, and the `--spec` and `--steps`
commands the lesson names. The same test reads the nine Orange listings in
N10 and checks the eight printed evaluations, the eight printed test
reports, and the `ORC0225` diagnostic of the empty loop. The same test
reads the Orange listings in N11 and checks their printed values, their
printed diagnostics, and the passing known-answer tests. The same test
reads the six Orange listings in N12 and checks the five printed
evaluations, the four printed test reports, and the `ORC0223` diagnostic
of the shifted index. The same test reads the six Orange listings in N13.
It checks `sha256.or` with `eval --spec abc` and its test, `hmac.or`
beside that file with its evaluation and four tests, and the repaired
seam the same way. It checks the `ORC0229` diagnostic of a missing
`use`, the `ORC0212` diagnostic of an unknown qualified function, and
the `ORC1001` diagnostic of a missing module file. `check`, `eval`, and
`test` of each rejected listing print that diagnostic and no value. The same test
reads the one Orange listing in N9 and checks its printed evaluation and
its passing test. The same test reads the three Orange listings in N14.
It checks `pad.or` with `eval --spec case1_key`, and `pad_seam.or`
beside that file with `eval --spec inner0` and its one test. It checks
`sample_line.or` with its evaluation and the report of a root that
declares no test. Run it in a
build-capable checkout:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path compiler/Cargo.toml -p orangec --test book_novice --locked --offline
```

The existence of this test is not a claim that a run passed. The PR and
delivery validation record identify which checks were actually executed.
No native code generation or cryptographic security claim is added.
